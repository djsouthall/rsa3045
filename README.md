# rsa3045

We have a RIGOL RSA 3045 Real-time Spectrum Analyzer in the lab that it would be useful to be able to control remotely.  I hope to be able to do so using the [pyvisa](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/getting.html) wrapper on the [VISA](http://www.ni.com/visa/).  If this doesn't work I may need to try and follow the examples given by the programming guide and use a language I am less comfortable with.
