# rsa3045

We have a RIGOL RSA 3045 Real-time Spectrum Analyzer in the lab that it would be useful to be able to control remotely.  The test.py script controls the spectruma analyzer using the [pyvisa](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/getting.html) wrapper on the [VISA](http://www.ni.com/visa/). 

The list of commands that work with the spectrum analyzer are listed in the [Programming Manual](https://beyondmeasure.rigoltech.com/acton/attachment/1579/f-0860/1/-/-/-/-/RSA3000_ProgrammingGuide.pdf).
